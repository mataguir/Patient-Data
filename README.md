# Patient-Data challenge

# Instructions to run app
 npm install
 
 npm start

# Some Explanations
 I removed the expand/collapse for more info. Instead, after clicking in "More Info", a modal is displayed. The Edit button is inside. The reason: the view wasn't friendly at all for a users and the extra click for editing is not a big deal.

 I'm not convinced with the place the Add Patient button ended up, but i wanted to be visible. Maybe in a menu, but it would be much extra work.

 I made all 'editable' field required.

 The only messages i thought were relevant to be displayed for the user are after creating a new patient and after editing one. In case the user enter invalid data or leave any field empty, validation messages should be displayed.

 The app is responsive.
